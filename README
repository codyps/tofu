TOFO: Trust On First Use
========================

Code to ease implimentations of systems that impliment trust-on-first-use, or
even systems that just need to support zero-downtime certificate upgrading.

Provides a mechanism for storing information (certificates, private keys, names)
for client & local systems to the filesystem.

Doesn't quite make usage fool proof yet due to allowing users to control naming
of certificates & hosts
